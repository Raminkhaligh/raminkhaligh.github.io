        <h2>Why Product & Marketing Drift Apart</h2>
        <p>In fast-moving organizations, product and marketing often diverge in goals — not due to lack of effort, but due to misaligned metrics. Marketing pushes to reduce CAC by leaning into cheaper, sometimes less effective channels, while product teams obsess over activation and conversion rates that tank when lower-quality leads arrive.</p>
        <p>This gap creates tension. Marketing claims the product isn’t converting well. Product blames lead quality. Leadership gets frustrated. Meanwhile, the user journey suffers.</p>
      </section>

        <h2>The Product Manager’s Role as Translator</h2>
        <p>In moments like this, a great product manager steps in — not as a referee, but as a <strong>translator</strong>. The PM’s job is to ensure both sides understand what the other is optimizing for, and how success connects to shared business outcomes.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Build shared metrics:</strong> Instead of marketing measuring CAC and product measuring CR, align both teams on <em>“Cost per Activated User”</em>.</li>
          <li><strong>Run joint experiments:</strong> PMs can help structure growth tests where both funnel quality and cost efficiency are evaluated together.</li>
          <li><strong>Use data storytelling:</strong> Translate performance data into insights each team can act on, not just dashboards to defend.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Facilitating Collaboration Instead of Blame</h2>
        <p>Conflict between product and marketing is often a symptom of siloed incentives. When each team operates on independent OKRs, tradeoffs become battles. The PM can bridge this by introducing <strong>shared planning rituals</strong> and <strong>cross-functional retros</strong>.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Shared quarterly planning:</strong> Co-create initiatives that tie top-of-funnel acquisition directly to in-product outcomes.</li>
          <li><strong>Transparent postmortems:</strong> When a campaign underperforms, invite both sides to deconstruct what happened — without blame.</li>
          <li><strong>Define boundaries clearly:</strong> Product shouldn’t dictate ad strategy, but should inform messaging and expectations.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Creating a Culture of “One Funnel” Thinking</h2>
        <p>Ultimately, alignment between product and marketing isn’t about meetings — it’s about culture. When both teams think of growth as one continuous funnel, not two disconnected goals, everything changes.</p>
        <blockquote>“Marketing brings users to the door; product keeps them inside. Success depends on how well the two agree on what the door looks like.”</blockquote>
        <p>As a PM, you’re the bridge — helping both sides plan, measure, and celebrate together. That’s how real cross-functional velocity is built.</p>
