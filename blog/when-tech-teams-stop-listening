      <h2>The Situation</h2>
      <p>
        It started with a simple request — a clear, documented need from marketing that was backed by data and user feedback.
        We provided everything: detailed specs, multiple discussions, and even mockups to make sure the tech team could deliver
        smoothly. Yet, deadlines slipped, communication stopped, and weeks later the output didn’t match the brief or quality
        expected. When we reviewed it, the work was rushed and disconnected from the goal.
      </p>

      <p>
        As the Product Marketing Manager, I escalated the issue to leadership. A review meeting was scheduled with the Head of Product,
        Tech Lead, and Frontend Lead. The intention was to realign and fix our collaboration.
      </p>

      <h2>Where It Went Wrong</h2>
      <p>
        Instead of constructive dialogue, the meeting turned into a blame session. The frontend lead started by complaining that
        “requirements keep changing” — which was simply not true. Every change had been documented and communicated well in advance.
        When I responded with facts, the conversation escalated emotionally. Eventually, both the tech and product heads joined
        the outburst — shouting, deflecting, and showing zero accountability.
      </p>

      <p>
        What could’ve been an opportunity for alignment became a demonstration of ego, frustration, and poor leadership. The meeting
        ended abruptly — without resolution, reflection, or ownership.
      </p>

      <h2>The Root Cause</h2>
      <p>
        The real issue wasn’t the feature or the deadlines — it was <strong>culture</strong>. A lack of shared goals and accountability
        between teams. The tech team saw marketing as “outsiders” making requests, not as partners solving for users. Product leadership
        avoided taking responsibility, and the result was a toxic feedback loop: no ownership → no collaboration → no growth.
      </p>

      <h2>What Should’ve Happened</h2>
      <ul style="color:var(--muted);">
        <li><strong>Shared OKRs</strong> — Product, tech, and marketing should all be accountable for one north-star metric.</li>
        <li><strong>Transparent processes</strong> — Weekly demos, async updates, and clear visibility into progress.</li>
        <li><strong>Psychological safety</strong> — Teams must be able to question, challenge, and contribute without fear of retaliation.</li>
        <li><strong>Ownership culture</strong> — Everyone owns the outcome, not just their “part” of the project.</li>
        <li><strong>Feedback loops</strong> — Replace blame with retrospectives. Problems are systems issues, not people issues.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Lesson</h2>
      <p>
        A company’s culture shows its true face not in success, but in how it handles tension. If your team can’t have hard conversations
        without ego or defensiveness, no framework or OKR will save you. True progress starts when leaders <em>listen before they react</em>
        — and when accountability becomes a shared mindset, not a finger to point.
      </p>

      <blockquote style="border-left:3px solid var(--accent);padding-left:1rem;color:var(--muted);margin:1.5rem 0;">
        “Culture isn’t built by slides — it’s built in meetings where people disagree, and still choose to collaborate.”
      </blockquote>

      <p><strong>Lesson in one line:</strong> Transparency isn’t optional — it’s the foundation of trust, delivery, and growth.</p>
