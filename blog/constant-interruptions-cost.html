      <h2>Situation</h2>
      <p>
        We were in the middle of an important sprint — one of those make-or-break cycles where the entire tech team was deep in flow.
        Every task was mapped, dependencies were clear, and everyone knew their part. Then it started happening:  
        my manager would suddenly appear, message, or call — not once, but repeatedly.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Haji, what happened to that feature?”  
        “This task should take two minutes.”  
        “Just push this one thing quickly.”  
      </p>

      <p>
        Each time, the context-switching broke momentum. Each “quick fix” turned into half a day of rework, testing, or debugging.
        And each interruption delayed the actual roadmap work — the same one we were being held accountable for.
      </p>

      <h2>Task</h2>
      <p>
        As the Product Marketing Manager, my role was to keep alignment — ensure the roadmap stayed on track while managing expectations upward.
        I needed to protect the team’s focus, communicate priorities clearly, and make sure leadership understood the cost of every “quick request.”
      </p>

      <h2>Action</h2>
      <p>
        I started documenting every unplanned task that came from leadership. For each request, I logged when it arrived, who made it, and what it impacted.
        Within two weeks, the list was long — over 12 unplanned requests, each one disrupting multiple people.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then, instead of confronting emotionally, I presented data:  
        how many sprint items were delayed, how much tech debt was created, and how the team’s cycle time had doubled.  
        I also proposed a simple solution — a “Focus Zone”: a protected block during the day when no one interrupts engineers unless it’s critical.
      </p>

      <h2>Result</h2>
      <p>
        Once the data was visible, the conversation shifted. The same manager who once said, “It’s a two-minute job,” realized the real cost:
        context-switching, burnout, and accumulated tech debt.  
        Within a month, we had better boundaries, fewer interruptions, and higher-quality output.  
        But most importantly, the team felt respected again.
      </p>

      <blockquote style="border-left:3px solid var(--accent);padding-left:1rem;color:var(--muted);margin:1.5rem 0;">
        “A leader’s job isn’t to move faster than the team — it’s to clear the path so the team can move without interruption.”
      </blockquote>

      <h2>The Lesson</h2>
      <p>
        Great leadership isn’t about constant motion — it’s about discipline.  
        Respect for planning and process is respect for people.  
        When leaders interrupt flow, they don’t accelerate progress — they sabotage it.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Lesson in one line:</strong> Protecting focus isn’t optional — it’s the foundation of quality, trust, and long-term speed.</p>
